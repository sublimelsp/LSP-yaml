# LSP-yaml

YAML support for Sublime's LSP plugin. Basically a fork of [sublimelsp/LSP-json](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-json).

Uses [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) to provide validation, formatting and other features for YAML files. See linked repository for more information.

By default, schemas are automatically retrieved from [schemastore.org](http://schemastore.org/).
